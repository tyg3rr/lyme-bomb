# lyme-bomb

This repository contains <i>some</i> of my data wrangling and analysis work for my Lyme Bomb research. 

The analysis was done in a Jupyter notebook. It is very messy because I used this project to teach myself python data analysis

Included is a PDF of my poster, created for and presented at the 2022 APHA Annual Meeting & Expo
